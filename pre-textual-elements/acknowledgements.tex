We give our special thanks to Eng. Mikhail Anatholy Koslowski, who gave us both
intellectual (since he once used an equipment with the same purpose) and
physical support (with components acquisition and equipments).
Also to our advisor \advisor, who was present even in the moment that the initial
idea came to life, in a situation nobody else would have stayed.
