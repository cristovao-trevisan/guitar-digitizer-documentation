\section{Pickup}
\label{pickup}

Electric guitars pickups are usually built by wrapping copper wire around magnets.
The working principle is based on the variation of magnetic field, created by the string
vibration. The vibration frequency of the string induces an electric signal on the output of the pickup \cite{pickup-work}
\cite{faraday-law}.

The designed pickup used the following main components:

{\begin{itemize}
  \item Base to assembly the set up magnet+coil
  \item 6 magnets
  \item Copper wire to wrap the magnets
  \item Cover to attach the set up on the guitar
\end{itemize}}

After some studies it was decided to build the pickup base using a 3D printer, due the
availability and reduced cost of this project. The model is showed on \autoref{3D-project}
and was projected using the AutoCAD software.

There were two materials available to print the model, \textit{PLA} (Polylatic Acid) \cite{3d-materials}
and \textit{ABS} (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) \cite{3d-materials}. It was decided to print
the model on PLA because it attends the requisites of robustness of the project, is
faster to print and have a lower cost when compared to the other materials. The built part is showed on
\autoref{3D-base} \\

With the pickup base ready, coils (\autoref{coils}) were built by manually wrapping copper wire around
each magnet (\autoref{magnets}). Similar hexaphonic pickups can be found at the
market and researching about them gave the number of 500 turns as a reasonable amount
of wiring. \\

After mount the coils, as showed on \autoref{coils} it was performed a test to verify the real voltage value induced by
the variation of the magnetic field. It was used the LM 741 \cite{LM741} with a gain of 10,
because it wasn't possible to verify the value on the coil output, with this simple test circuit
it was possible to verify that the output value on the IC was 1mV, this value indicate that the
output value on the coil is around 0.1mV. \\

After test one coil it was assemble the other five coils and assembled the pickup, as
showed on \autoref{6coils} and \autoref{assembled-pickup}
