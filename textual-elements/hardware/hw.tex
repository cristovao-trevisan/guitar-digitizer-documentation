\section{Initial Idea}
The project started with the idea of assembly a system which should capture de guitar sound and change the sound to any another instrument. The system should be competitive with other existent devices.\\
To reach this objective it was verified the features which the project should reach and the methods necessaries to perform the desired actions.\\
\section{Pickup Project} 
After some studies it was decided to assembly a hexaphonic pickup instead buy one already manufactured, which is an expansive device. To reduce the cost of the project it was projected and printed the pickup base on 3D printer as the project showed on figure 1.

\end{figure}

After print the pickup base it was assembled the coils, composed by guitar magnets and copper iron (150 revolutions for each magnet), responsible for the transformation of the mechanic vibration of the string to the electric signal which is needed.

With the pickup already assembled it was verified the output signal. This signal pick was about 0.5 mV and ths value was so weak to send to the Analogic-digital converter present on the microprocessor. With this dungeon it was verified that it is needed a circuit responsible for the signal amplification to be possible to read the signal with quality on the microprocessor. 

\section{Amplifier Circuits}
It was researched some types of amplifiers circuits, it was selected the circuits with single supply, because the project was designed to be the maximum embedded on the guitar, without the needing of other supplies except the guitar battery or the USB connection of the microprocessor.
After some researches it was decided try two circuit types, with two different operational amplifiers. The first circuit uses the Texas Instruments INA 326 Instrumental Amplifier and the second uses the Texa Instruments TLV 4316 Operational Amplifier.

\subsection{INA 326}
The project using the INA 326 IC, started with a research at the datasheet of this compnent and it was verified one circuit which provides the desired Gain to the electric signal from the pickup respecting the project's initial requests. The circuit is shown on figure 3. 

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{textual-elements/hardware/Texas}
\caption{Amplifier assembly}
\end{figure}

This circuit amplifies the signal and the gain is obtained by the following equation:

$$G=2*\frac{(R_2||R_2 ')}{R_1}$$

On the project the Resistor $R_0$ and the Capacitor $C_0$ was excluded because it was not relevant on the output to this project. After the research it was developed a schematic model to perform some simulation tests to verify and prove the functionalism of the circuit for the desired application. The schematic circuit it was developed using the software CadSoft Eagle Professional 7.6.0 until the version showed at figure 4.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]

\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{textual-elements/hardware/INA}
\caption{Schematic for each channel}
\end{figure}

This circuit as showed on the image provides a Gain of:

$$G=2*\frac{(1M\Omega||1M\Omega)}{10k\Omega}$$
$$G=2*\frac{500k\Omega}{10k\Omega}$$
$$G=2*50$$
$$G=100$$

The amplifier circuit was projected to each channel. So the circuit needed 6 IC INA 326 to be complete. The complete schematic is showed on annex 1. After project the schematic circuit to each channel it was developed the PCB project, using the same software described on the schematic modelling. The PCI project is showed on figure 5.\\

This PCB project was projected on a dual layer board scheme, using 15 mils of minimum width for the conductive tracks. It was assembled on FR4 dual layer copper board, combining the through-hole and surface-mount technologies. This choice was made due the facility of the assembly of the through-hole components. It was sent the files to one person who works with printing PCB boards. After the processes the PCB was like figure 6.\\

On this project it was used:

\begin{itemize}
\item 6 Instrumental Amplifiers INA 326;
\item 6 10k$\Omega$ Trimmer Potentiometer;
\item 6 10nF Ceramic Capacitor;
\item 6 100nF x 50V Electrolitic Capacitor;
\item 12 10k$\Omega$ 5 Percent Tolerance Resistor;
\item 12 1M$\Omega$ 5 Percent Tolerance Resistor;
\item 1 6 positions Pin bar;
\item 1 12 positions dual track Pin bar;
\item 1 2 positions Pin bar;
\end{itemize}  

After soldering all the components it was performed some bench tests to verify the functionality of the amplifier circuit. The result showed us that the circuit attends the required function, amplifying the signal from a pick of 10mV to a pick of 1V, proving that the circuit is working perfectly and attending the demand of the project. After the bench test the system was connected to the pickup to verify if the guitar signal would be amplified as needed to the conversion process. The result was satisfactory and attended well the purpose to the project, as showed on image 6.

\subsection{TLV 4316}
The project of TLV 4316 started on the same way of the INA 326 project. It started verifying the datasheet
