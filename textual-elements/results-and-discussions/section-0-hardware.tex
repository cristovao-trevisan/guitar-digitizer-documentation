\section{Hardware Results and Discussions}

\subsection{Results}
The hardware project showed be reliable and robust. The amplification worked
well for the musical instrument signal in order to be further acquired by the
microcontroller ADC, digitizing the signal as expected.
The project proved to be challenging -- completely assembling a
hexaphonic pickup and the amplifier system, but it has performed successfully.

\subsection{Future Improvements}
For the future and thinking on production it is thought to test some INA326 IC
for other supplier, as the imported from Chinese suppliers, to verify if the results
are acceptable as the prototype amplifier, this change is thinking on low the cost,
but thinking on quality maintenance.
With this change other could be performed, as change all the through-hole components
by the surface mount (SMD). This should low the costs and could lower the board dimensions.
Other change that could be performed is change the trimmers potentiometers by programmable
resistors, this change will be responsible by adjust the amplifier gain automatically.
It is ideal to perform the magnet wrapping automatically. This improvement will help on time
production, component quality, component cost and component dimensions.
Other improvement is to comunicate with the firmware using wirless communication,
this advance will bring more mobility to the gadget, because the firmware will not more be
assembled on the PCB, which signifies that it will not have the PC connection cable from the guitar.
