\subsubsection{Note Detection}
Real time note detection proved not to be so accurate. Legato (connected) notes
may cause a middle note detection and there are misdetections (mostly at frequency
transitions). It works well enough for live play of MIDI instruments, but not
for music notation. \\
For real world music notation a different solution is needed: record the signals
and post-process them. This way it is possible to use a more detailed analysis
of each signal and thus get very good results, as there is much more computing
power available when not being limited by real-time processing.

\subsubsection{Performance}
Though real time analysis work, a few limitations were detected. Buffering can only
process each data point one time (can't use a sliding buffer that recycles data).
This means that we are close to the processing limits, due to two causes: single
core processing and slow algorithms. \\
One step of the solution is to use multi-core processing for the pitch detection,
which can be done using Node.js support for it. \\
As already stated (\autoref{pitch-detection-implementation}) the current implementation
uses quadratic growth algorithms, when they can be implemented with logarithmic
growth. Fixing this will improve the performance to a point where multi-core processing
won't be even needed.
